Logisparte is a software engineering cooperative that provides development, consulting and
training services to businesses.

## Identity

Logisparte is based in [Quebec City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_City) and is owned by
quebecers.

Logisparte is the property of its engineer-partners (_hómoioi_), which all equally participate
in the labor, profits and losses of the business.

Engineer-partners are bound by an oath to always protect the public, their colleagues and the
interests of their customers. Engineer-partners are expected to strive for excellence, to
improve the state-of-the-art of their craft and to be examples for their peers. Our core values
are:

### Mastery

We dedicate ourselves to the highest standards of our profession. We're constantly looking to
improve our work and our know-how. Computers are extensions of our minds. We do not let pressure
get the best of us. We stay calm in the storm.

### Love of our craft

We take pride in our work. We believe the small details make a difference. We love to solve
complex problems. We're curious, creative and resourceful.

### Ethics

We're honest. We stay humble. We own our mistakes. We have the courage of our convictions. We do
not treat others in a way we wouldn't want them to treat us. We strive to pass on a better world
to those who will succeed us. People are more important than machines. Health and family always
come first. When having a meeting, we let everyone have their say. When facing adversity, we
have each other's back.
